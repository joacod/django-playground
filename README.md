## üëã Introduction

Project created using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

## üìã Prerequisites

Install **Python**, follow the [official documentation](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

**Expected output**: Creates an isolated Python environment in `/venv`

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activates the virtual environment, updating your shell to use the isolated Python.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Expected output**: Prompt changes to `(venv) user@machine:~/django-playground$`

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What it does**: Installs project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## üíª Development Server

Run the project locally.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**What it does**: Starts a local server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin interface, you need a superuser account. Run:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up your admin credentials.

Once the server is running, access the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (Vite + React)

A separate frontend app is available in the `frontend` folder, built with Vite and React. This app is intended for use with the Django REST Framework (DRF) APIs.

### Running the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies (only needed once):

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## üìù Choosing Your Development Approach

- **Django Development Server**: Running `python manage.py runserver` will serve your Django app, including any pages rendered with Django templates (e.g., server-side HTML views).
- **Frontend (React) App**: Running the frontend dev server allows you to build and test a modern React SPA that consumes your Django REST API.

You can use either approach, or both at the same time:

- Use Django templates for traditional server-rendered pages.
- Use the React frontend for a modern SPA experience with DRF APIs.

Both can be run in parallel for full flexibility during development.
